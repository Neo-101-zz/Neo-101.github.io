This article briefly introduces how to install ESA's SNAP and configure snap-python on Mac and Windows.

# Mac

### 1. Install Anaconda

### 2. Install Java and JDK

### 3. Install jpy

Jpy is a **bi-directional** Python-Java Bridge. Download and follow the guide from [here](https://github.com/bcdev/jpy).

If some error message containing 'mvn' occurs, it may because the absence of Maven. It can be downloaded from [here](https://maven.apache.org/). 

After the installation of jpy, there will be a `build` directory and a `dist` directory in the `jpy-master` directory. 

Copy `build` directory into Anaconda's `site-packages' directory. It maybe `/Users/USERNAME/anaconda3/lib/PYTHON3.X/site-packages` or something else.
