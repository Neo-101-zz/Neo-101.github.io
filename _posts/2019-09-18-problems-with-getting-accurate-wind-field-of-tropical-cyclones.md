# Satellite Passive Microwave Radiometers
* **The measurement of ocean surface wind speeds during precipitation events.** While algorithms have been developed that are able to measure ocean surface wind speeds with an accuracy of ~2 m/s, in rain-free conditions, unfortunately, they break down completely as soon as light rain is present.
* **The new generation of microwave radiometers (SMOS, SMAP, ASMR-2) are not good at systematically providing reliable inner-core wind structure in TCs.** Because they has rather coarse spatial resolution, on the order of ~40-50 km.
